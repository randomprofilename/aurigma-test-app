RECITALS

 

Use of NVIDIA's products requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, the hardware on a graphics controller board, and a personal computer. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for use, strictly in accordance with this LICENSE. The hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but this LICENSE does not cover that sale. This LICENSE sets forth the terms and conditions of the SOFTWARE use only.

1. DEFINITIONS

1.1 Customer. Customer means the entity or individual that downloads the SOFTWARE.

2. GRANT OF LICENSE

2.1 Rights and Limitations of Grant. NVIDIA hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the SOFTWARE for use with NVIDIA GeForce or Titan branded hardware products owned by Customer, subject to the following:

2.1.1 Rights. Customer may install and use multiple copies of the SOFTWARE on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers, and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for Customer's use within Customer's Enterprise. "Enterprise" shall mean individual use by Customer or any legal entity (such as a corporation or university) and the subsidiaries it owns by more than fifty percent (50%).

2.1.2 Linux/FreeBSD Exception. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section 2.1.1, SOFTWARE designed exclusively for use on the Linux or FreeBSD operating systems, or other operating systems derived from the source code to these operating systems, may be copied and redistributed, provided that the binary files thereof are not modified in any way (except for unzipping of compressed files).

2.1.3 Limitations.

No Modification or Reverse Engineering. Customer may not modify (except as provided in Section 2.1.2), reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain the source code.

No Separation of Components. The SOFTWARE is licensed as a single product. Its component parts may not be separated for use on more than one computer, nor otherwise used separately from the other parts.

No Sublicensing or Distribution. Customer may not sell, rent, sublicense, distribute or transfer the SOFTWARE; or use the SOFTWARE for public performance or broadcast; or provide commercial hosting services with the SOFTWARE.

No Datacenter Deployment. The SOFTWARE is not licensed for datacenter deployment, except that blockchain processing in a datacenter is permitted.

3. TERMINATION

This LICENSE will automatically terminate if Customer fails to comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof. In such event, Customer must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its component parts.

Defensive Suspension. If Customer commences or participates in any legal proceeding against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion, suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights provided under this LICENSE during the pendency of such legal proceedings.

4. OWNERSHIP

All title and intellectual property rights in and to the SOFTWARE (including but not limited to all images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and other information incorporated into the SOFTWARE), the accompanying materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE, are owned by NVIDIA or its suppliers.

5. APPLICABLE LAW AND BINDING ARBITRATION

Governing Law. This LICENSE shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to or application of its conflict of laws rules or principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed.

 

Arbitration. For any claim against or dispute or controversy with NVIDIA relating to this LICENSE or that may arise from it or out of use of the SOFTWARE (collectively, “Disputes”), Customer agrees to first contact NVIDIA by U.S. Mail at NVIDIA Corporation, ATTN: Legal, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California, 95051 and attempt to resolve the Dispute with NVIDIA informally. In the unlikely event that NVIDIA has not been able to resolve such Dispute it has with Customer within 60 days of Customer’s original informal claim (or sooner if, in NVIDIA's opinion, a Dispute is not likely to be resolved within 60 days), Customer and NVIDIA each agree to resolve any such Dispute (excluding any NVIDIA claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) by binding arbitration before an arbitrator from Judicial Mediation and Arbitration Services ("JAMS") located in Santa Clara County, California under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California (or the nearest JAMS Office to Santa Clara County), unless Customer requests an in-person hearing in Customer’s hometown or Customer and NVIDIA agree otherwise. Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party's data security, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights. If for any reason this agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to a Dispute and as a result a Dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court in Santa Clara County, California.

 

Class Action & Jury Trial Waiver. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION UNLESS SUCH ARBITRATION IS NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE COURT CLASS ACTION WAIVER OR IN THE EVENT THAT CLASS ARBITRATION IS EXPRESSLY AGREED TO BY NVIDIA. CUSTOMER AGREES THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS LICENSE, CUSTOMER AND NVIDIA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.


Right to Opt Out. CUSTOMER MAY OPT OUT OF THE FOREGOING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION OF THIS LICENSE BY NOTIFYING NVIDIA IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF COMMENCEMENT OF USE OF THE SOFTWARE UNDER THIS LICENSE. SUCH WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE SENT TO ATTN: LEGAL, 2788 SAN TOMAS EXPRESSWAY, SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA, 95051 AND MUST INCLUDE (1) CUSTOMER’S NAME, (2) CUSTOMER’S ADDRESS, (3) THE REFERENCE TO GEFORCE SOFTWARE AS THE SOFTWARE THE NOTICE RELATES TO, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT INDICATING THAT CUSTOMER DOES NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH ARBITRATION AND DEMONSTRATING COMPLIANCE WITH THE 30 DAY TIME LIMIT TO OPT OUT.

 

6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY

 

6.1 No Warranties. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND NVIDIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, RELATING TO OR ARISING FROM THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer is solely responsible for determining and verifying that the SOFTWARE that Customer obtains and installs is the appropriate version for Customer’s model of graphics controller board, operating system, and computer hardware.

 

6.2 Limitations of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NVIDIA OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, OR FOR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE EXCEED THE NET AMOUNT PAID TO NVIDIA FOR CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE PARTICULAR SOFTWARE UPON WHICH LIABILITY IS BASED, OR US$10.00 IF NVIDIA RECEIVED NO FEES FOR CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE SOFTWARE.

7. SYSTEM UPDATES
